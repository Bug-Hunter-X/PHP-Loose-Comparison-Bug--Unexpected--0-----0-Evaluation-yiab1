The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality.

```php
<?php
$value = isset($_GET['value']) ? $_GET['value'] : 0;

if ($value === 0) {
  echo 'Value is zero (integer).';
} elseif ($value === '0') {
  echo 'Value is zero (string).';
} else {
  echo 'Value is not zero.';
}
?>
```

This revised code explicitly checks for both integer and string representations of zero, providing more predictable and secure behavior.  Always prefer strict comparisons (`===`) in your code to prevent unintended consequences due to PHP's type juggling.
